        "### Description\n",
        "The Global Dryland Assessment Data Set provides comprehensive information on dryland regions across the globe. The dataset includes geographic coordinates, aridity zones, land use categories, and tree cover information for various locations. It is crucial for understanding the distribution and characteristics of dryland regions, covering a significant portion of the Earth's surface. The dataset is compiled from multiple sources and has been pre-processed to ensure topological integrity and consistency.\n",
